# 🎭 In-Persona Prompt Pattern
*Notes by Siri Moen Gjersøe – part of Prompt Engineering self-study (2025)*

## What it is
The **in-persona pattern** means instructing the model to adopt a specific identity, role, or viewpoint before generating a response.

Example:
> “You are a Norwegian linguist specializing in terminology standardization.”

This framing gives the model a *contextual identity* that shapes its tone, style, and reasoning.

---

## How to Use It
1. **Define the persona clearly**  
   e.g., “You are an academic writing coach helping researchers express ideas clearly.”

2. **Set the context and goal**  
   Tell the model what the persona is doing and for whom.

3. **Then give the task**  
   e.g., “Suggest improvements for clarity.”

## Why It Makes a Difference
- Adds context → more focused answers  
- Improves relevance → domain-specific tone  
- Increases control → you guide both *content* and *form*  
- Boosts creativity → the model role-plays effectively

## Example
Without persona:
> “Explain bounded rationality.”

With persona:
> “You are Herbert Simon explaining bounded rationality to first-year psychology students using a real-life example.”

---

## Reflection
Using personas helps prompt designers control output style and perspective — useful in education, content creation, and research assistance.
